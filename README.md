"You have an array of fruits
const fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Orange', 'Lemon'];
The task is to render that array as an ordered list to the html page via JavaScript. Your algorithm should detect fruit Apple and prepend to this name a word ‘Only’. As a result you should see the next list:
1. Banana
2. Only Apple
3. Orange
4. Lemon
You can add HTML/CSS markup on your mind"
